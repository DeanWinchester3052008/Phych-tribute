          <p class="sectionSubtag textSmall">In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity <br>
            I'm not inclined to resign to maturity <br>
            If it's all right, then you're all wrong <br>
            Why bounce around to the same damn song <br> 
            You'd rather run when you can't crawlI know, you know <br>
            That I'm not telling the truth <br>
            I know, you know <br>
            They just don't have any proof  <br>
            Embrace the deception
            Learn how to bend  <br>
            Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end
